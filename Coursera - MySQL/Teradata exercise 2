## Exercise 1
## (a) Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct skus there are in the skuinfo, skstinfo, and trnsact tables. 
## Which skus are common to all tables, or unique to specific tables?

DATABASE ua_dillards;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku) AS NumSku
FROM skuinfo;
# 1564178

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku) AS NumSku
FROM skstinfo;
# 760212

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sku) AS NumSku
FROM trnsact;
# 714499

# Num of distinct skus in skuinfo > in skstinfo > in trnsact

## (b) Use COUNT to determine how many instances there are of each sku associated with each store in the skstinfo table and the trnsact table?

SELECT sku, store, COUNT(*) AS NumInstance
FROM skstinfo
GROUP BY sku, store
ORDER BY NumInstance DESC;
# 1 instance for each 

SELECT sku, store, COUNT(*) AS NumInstance
FROM trnsact
GROUP BY sku, store
ORDER BY NumInstance DESC;
# Max 7933 instances for each combination

## Exercise 2
## Use COUNT and DISTINCT to determine how many distinct stores there are in the strinfo, store_msa, skstinfo, and trnsact tables. 
## Which stores are common to all tables, or unique to specific tables?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store) AS NumStore
FROM strinfo;
# 453

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store) AS NumStore
FROM store_msa;
# 333

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store) AS NumStore
FROM skstinfo;
# 357

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT store) AS NumStore
FROM trnsact;
# 332

# Num of distinct stores in strinfo > in skstinfo > in store_msa > in trnsact

## Exercise 3
## Examine some of the skus rows in the trnsact table that are not in the skstinfo table. 
## Find any common features that could explain why the cost information is missing.

SELECT t.*
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN skstinfo s
ON t.sku = s.sku AND t.store = s.store
WHERE s.sku IS NULL;

## Exercise 4
## Although we can’t complete all the analyses we’d like to on Dillard’s profit, we can look at general trends. 
## What is Dillard’s average profit per day?

SELECT SUM(t.amt-s.cost)/COUNT(DISTINCT t.saledate) AS AvgProfit
FROM trnsact t LEFT JOIN skstinfo s
ON t.sku = s.sku AND t.store = s.store
WHERE t.stype = 'P';
# 1527903

## Exercise 5
## On what day was the total value (in $) of returned goods the greatest? 
## On what day was the total number of individual returned items the greatest?

SELECT saledate, SUM(amt)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'R'
GROUP BY saledate
ORDER BY SUM(amt) DESC;
# 04/12/27

SELECT saledate, SUM(quantity)
FROM trnsact
WHERE stype = 'R'
GROUP BY saledate
ORDER BY SUM(quantity) DESC;
# 04/12/27

## Exercise 6
## What is the maximum price paid for an item in our database? 
## What is the minimum price paid for an item in our database?

SELECT sprice
FROM trnsact
ORDER BY sprice DESC;
# 6017.00

SELECT sprice
FROM trnsact
ORDER BY sprice;
# 0.00

## Exercise 7
## How many departments have more than 100 brands associated with them, and what are their descriptions?

SELECT s.dept, d.deptdesc, COUNT(s.brand)
FROM deptinfo d RIGHT JOIN skuinfo s
ON d.dept = s.dept
GROUP BY s.dept, d.deptdesc
HAVING COUNT(s.brand) > 100;
# 60

## Exercise 8
## Write a query that retrieves the department descriptions of each of the skus in the skstinfo table.

SELECT s.sku, d.deptdesc 
FROM skstinfo s LEFT JOIN skuinfo
ON s.sku = skuinfo.sku
LEFT JOIN deptinfo d
ON skuinfo.dept = d.dept
GROUP BY s.sku, d.deptdesc;

## Exercise 9
## What department (with department description), brand, style, and color had the greatest total value of returned items?

SELECT d.dept, d.deptdesc, s.brand, s.style, s.color, SUM(t.amt)
FROM skuinfo s LEFT JOIN deptinfo d
ON s.dept = d.dept
LEFT JOIN trnsact t 
ON s.sku = t.sku
WHERE t.stype = 'R'
GROUP BY d.dept, d.deptdesc, s.brand, s.style, s.color
ORDER BY SUM(t.amt) DESC;
# 4505    POLOMEN    POLO    FAS    4GZ 782633    U KHAKI

## Exercise 10
## In what state and zip code is the store that had the greatest total revenue during the time period monitored in our dataset?

SELECT s.state, s.zip, SUM(t.amt)
FROM store_msa s LEFT JOIN trnsact t
ON s.store = t.store
WHERE t.stype = 'P'
GROUP BY s.state, s.zip
ORDER BY SUM(t.amt) DESC;
