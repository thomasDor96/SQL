## 7. Compare the average daily revenue of the store with the highest msa_income and the store with the lowest median msa_income 
## (according to the msa_income field). In what city and state were these two stores, and which store had a higher average daily revenue?



## 8. Divide the msa_income groups up so that msa_incomes between 1 and 20,000 are labeled 'low', msa_incomes between 20,001 and 30,000 
## are labeled 'med-low', msa_incomes between 30,001 and 40,000 are labeled 'med-high', and msa_incomes between 40,001 and 60,000 are 
## labeled 'high'. Which of these groups has the highest average daily revenue per store?


## 9. Divide stores up so that stores with msa populations between 1 and 100,000 are labeled 'very small', stores with msa populations 
## between 100,001 and 200,000 are labeled 'small', stores with msa populations between 200,001 and 500,000 are labeled 'med_small', 
## stores with msa populations between 500,001 and 1,000,000 are labeled 'med_large', stores with msa populations between 1,000,001 
## and 5,000,000 are labeled “large”, and stores with msa_population greater than 5,000,000 are labeled “very large”. What is the 
## average daily revenue for a store in a “very large” population msa?




## 10. Which department in which store had the greatest percent increase in average daily sales revenue from November to December, and
